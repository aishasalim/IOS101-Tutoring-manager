Mobile App Dev - Final Project App
===

For the final project, it'd be good to use all the tech things covered by a course:

- API
- Scrollbar list
- Navigation bar swiping
- Information that stays in the app after stopping it

## Top 3 New App Ideas
1. Management app for Tutoring Center
So, I work in The Tutoring center, and they did not change any of their management setups since 1990s. My center doesn't have any system that keeps the amount of students and their information up to date. 

In the app, I'd like to see:
- Main Page - Dashboard cards with the amount of:
  1. Active students
  2. Withdrewing students
  3. Amount of leads that are not students yet
  4. Students that are not in the center but were previously

- Add a Student tab - You add all the students information:
  1. Student's name
  2. Student's grade
  3. Parents full name
  4. Parent email
  5. Parent phone number to send messages on
  6. notes entry for future
- Tumbler list of students that can be sorted. After tapping on student you can see details that were added from a form. 
FEATURE?? - Add an option of email/message sending with ready templates txt/json file. 


2. Movie app for dating

 - You and your partner add films they want to watch
 - App shows random film chosen to watch it with your date

3. Coffee recipes app

 - App that uses API with coffee recipes
 - list of liked/pined recipes 
 - add your own recipes
